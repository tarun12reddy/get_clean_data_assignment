This program requires a zip file with Samsung data to work. This data can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ).

The program creates a data.frame of 180 observations with 68 variables.

The first 66 are the means and standard deviations for each of the different features in the Samsung data (see here for more details).

The final two variables are as follows:

### act (factor)
The activity that took place

### sbj
The ID of the volunteer participant.
